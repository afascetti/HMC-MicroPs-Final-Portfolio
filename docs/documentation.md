## Schematics
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

The hardware for the system include the Adafruit PN532 Breakout Board, Nucleo Microcontroller, Upduino ICE40 FPGA, and a speaker with an audio amplifier. The audio amplifier (a TI LM386) is in place to allow the speaker to draw more current than the FPGA pin would allow. The audio amplifier circuit comes from the LM386 datasheet.[^1]

## Source Code Overview
<!-- This section should include information to describe the organization of the code base and highlight how the code connects. -->
The code base for this project is broken into three sections: 

* MCU code, written in C
* FPGA code, written in SystemVerilog
* FPGA testbenches, also written in SystemVerilog

The source code for the project is located in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/afascetti/HMC-MicroPs-Final-Portfolio/tree/main/src).

# MCU Code
Our microcontroller code includes multiple library files, using the CMCIS structures, and a `main.c` file in which all of the library files are included. The library files are named `STM32L432KC_x.c` where x is the name of the peripheral driven by that library. For example, the I2C is used to communicate with the PN532 RFID/NCF Controller. The I2C driver is named `STM32L432KC_I2C.c`.

The `main.c` file calls functions from the various libraries and allows the MCU to act as the controller for both I2C (to the PN532) and SPI (to the FPGA).


For more information see the [design](https://afascetti.github.io/HMC-MicroPs-Final-Portfolio/design/) page.

# FPGA Code
The code to program the FPGA resides in one SystemVerilog file titled `main.sv`. The first module in this file, top, controls the FGPA and calls the other modules as needed. 

The module entitled `tune` is the main finite state machine (FSM) for the FPGA. Below is the full netlist (all of the connections between modules) on the FPGA.

# FPGA Testbenches
A series of testbenches were created to test the FPGA prior to the integration with the MCU. 

These testbenches are listed as follows:

* SPI
* Main FSM (the `tune` module)
* Frequency generator
* Duration counter
* Decomposition of the MCU output
* Enables for the system
* Top module
